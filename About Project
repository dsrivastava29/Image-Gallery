Image Gallery:

Using this application the user must be able to add as many pictures to the page as he wants by clicking on the “+” button. 
Each picture has text associated with it describing the picture which can be used for searching the picture by typing search 
  queries in the search text field, the filtering has to be live i.e. on text input.
